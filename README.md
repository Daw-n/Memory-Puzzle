# Memory-Puzzle
A game made in Unity 3d with C#. Pairs of cards need to be matched with scoring, moves and criteria of getting stars. 3 stars if number of moves is equal to number of pairs. If an additional move is made then 2 stars otherwise 1 star. The difference is the 3D rotation effect of cards.
